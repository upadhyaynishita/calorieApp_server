BurnOut is an easy to use application that keeps track of a user's daily calories gained and burnt. It can help the user to set goals such as weight loss/gain. Users can edit their profile by entering their height, weight, goal and target-weight. Users can enroll into numerous programs involving fitness such as yoga classes and workout sessions. Users can now connect with their friends by sending a friend-request and share their progress. This document provides a major perspective for the users to understand and take up the project as an Open source software and add on multiple features before releasing to the market. Also, the document aids the developers in understanding the code and acts as a reference point for continuing the project.

## User History Plot

We have used python in the backend to fetch the current weight and goal weight of a person from python collection. We have also implemented a diet recommendation model which gives the user a 30 day diet plan stored in [diet_guide.txt](https://github.com/atharva1996/calorieApp_server/blob/main/model/diet_guide.txt) and intend to integrate this with the application in the further stage of this project. The graphs below demonstrate weight loss prediction if the diet is followed as prescribed.
